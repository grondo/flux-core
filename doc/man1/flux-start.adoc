FLUX-START(1)
=============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux-start - bootstrap a local Flux instance


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *start* ['OPTIONS'] [initial-program [args...]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-start(1) launches a new Flux instance.  By default, flux-start
execs a single flux-broker(1) directly.  By default it will attempt to use
PMI to fetch job information and bootstrap a flux instance.

If a size is specified via '--size', an instance of that size is to be
started on the local host with flux-start as the parent. (Mostly used for testing
purposes.)

A failure of the initial program (such as non-zero exit code)
causes flux-start to exit with a non-zero exit code.

Note: in order to launch a Flux instance, you must have generated
long-term CURVE keys using flux-keygen(1).

OPTIONS
-------
*-s, --size*='N'::
Launch an instance of size 'N' on the local host.  Only works with
'--bootstrap=selfpmi'.  Automatically sets '--bootstrap=selfpmi' and prints
a warning to stderr if no '--bootstrap' option is specified.

*-b, --bootstrap*='METHOD'::
Select the flux bootstrap method.  Possible values of 'METHOD' are:
  * pmi - Use PMI (Process Management Interface)
  * selfpmi - The flux-start process will activate its own internal PMI server,
    and then it will launch flux-brokers that will bootstrap using said PMI server.

*-o, --broker-opts*='option_string'::
Add options to the message broker daemon, separated by commas.

*-v, --verbose*::
Display commands before executing them.

*-X, --noexec*::
Don't execute anything.  This option is most useful with -v.

*--caliper-profile*='PROFILE'::
Run brokers with Caliper profiling enabled, using a Caliper
configuration profile named 'PROFILE'. Requires a version of Flux
built with --enable-caliper. Unless CALI_LOG_VERBOSITY is already
set in the environment, it will default to 0 for all brokers.

*--scratchdir*='DIR'::
For selfpmi bootstrap mode, set a pre-existing directory that will
contain the generated broker.rundir directories for the instance.
If a DIR is not set with this option, a unique temporary directory will
be created for the lifetime of the instance and removed when the
instance is destroyed.

*--wrap*='ARGS,...'::
Wrap broker execution in a comma-separated list of arguments. This is
useful for running flux-broker directly under debuggers or valgrind.


EXAMPLES
--------

Launch an 8-way local Flux instance with an interactive shell as the
initial program and all logs output to stderr:

  flux start -s8 -o,--setattr=log-stderr-level=7

Launch an 8-way Flux instance within a slurm job, with an interactive
shell as the initial program:

  srun --pty -N8 flux start
